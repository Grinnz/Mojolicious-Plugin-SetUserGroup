=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::SetUserGroup - Mojolicious plugin to set unprivileged
credentials

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Mojolicious
  $self->plugin(SetUserGroup => {user => $user, group => $group});
  
  # Mojolicious::Lite
  plugin SetUserGroup => {user => $user, group => $group};
  
  # Production mode only
  plugin SetUserGroup => {user => $user, group => $group}
    if $self->mode eq 'production';
  
  # Root only
  plugin SetUserGroup => {user => $user, group => $group}
    if $> == 0;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is intended to replace the C<setuidgid> functionality of
L<Mojo::Server>. It should be loaded in application startup and it will change
the user and group credentials of the process when L<Mojo::IOLoop> is started,
which occurs in each worker process of a L<Mojo::Server::Prefork> daemon like
L<hypnotoad>.

This allows an application to be started as root so it can bind to privileged
ports such as port 80 or 443, but run worker processes as unprivileged users.
However, if the application is not started as root, it will most likely fail to
change credentials. So, you should only set the user/group when the application
is started as root or a user with the C<CAP_SETUID> and C<CAP_SETGID>
L<capabilities(7)>.

This plugin only works on systems with a concept of Unix users and groups, such
as Linux, OS X, or BSD.

The L<morbo> development server is currently incompatible with this plugin as
the lowered credentials causes the application worker to shut down. Make sure
credential changes do not occur when running your application under morbo,
either by not registering the plugin under that condition, or starting morbo
under the target user and group so no change occurs.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::SetUserGroup> inherits all methods from
L<Mojolicious::Plugin> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 register

  $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new, {user => $user, group => $group});

Install callback to change process credentials on the next L<Mojo::IOLoop>
tick. If option C<user> is undefined or the current user and group are already
correct, no credential change will occur. If option C<group> is undefined but
C<user> is defined, the group will be set to a group matching the user name. If
credential changes fail, an error will be logged and the process will be
stopped.
